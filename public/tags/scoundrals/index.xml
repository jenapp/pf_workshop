      <description>&amp;ldquo;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo; â€•&amp;ldquo;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&amp;rdquo; Little is known of Holmes&amp;rsquo; early life or his family background, save that his grandmother was a sister of the French artist Vernet. An estimate of Holmes&amp;rsquo;s age in &amp;ldquo;His Last Bow&amp;rdquo; places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as 60 years of age.</description>
