[{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026ldquo;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; ―\u0026ldquo;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\u0026rdquo; Little is known of Holmes\u0026rsquo; early life or his family background, save that his grandmother was a sister of the French artist Vernet. An estimate of Holmes\u0026rsquo;s age in \u0026ldquo;His Last Bow\u0026rdquo; places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as 60 years of age. It is also known that in his younger years, Holmes attended at least one of the country\u0026rsquo;s leading universities \u0026hellip; though it cannot be ascertained whether he was an alumnus of Oxford, Cambridge, or both. Sherlock has an older brother, Mycroft, whom the younger Holmes considered to be more intellectually gifted than himself. Mycroft spent much of his life in Her Majesty\u0026rsquo;s Secret Service. In \u0026ldquo;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\u0026rdquo;, Sherlock refers to Mycroft as being \u0026ldquo;[s]even years [his] senior\u0026rdquo;. If Sherlock date of birth of 1854 is correct, that places Mycroft\u0026rsquo;s date of birth as 1847.\n","permalink":"https://example.com/publications/howtodeduce/","tags":["Pipes","Crime","Scoundrals","CI/CD pipelines","agile","Culture"],"title":"My name is Sherlock Holmes."},{"categories":null,"contents":"This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:\nDon’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow. Favor deep end-to-end accomplishments over broad but incremental steps forward. Focus on taking the right teams far before encouraging broad adoption. Centralize the platforms and tools that your teams shouldn’t be thinking about. Provide foundational services/commodities and let teams stay on purpose. Incorporate contributions from everyone; don’t stifle autonomy. Stay open to new ways of working. Challenge security policies, but respect intentions. Find new ways to enforce concerns without abandoning precaution.
